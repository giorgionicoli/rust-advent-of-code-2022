# Advent of Code 2022 - Rust edition

Finally it's that time of the year again! 

For the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/), I decided to solve the challenges using Rust! I'm quite a beginner with Rust, so my solutions might disturb some more proficient developers, but oh well, we need to start somewhere :)

I'm also open to suggestions and improvements to the solutions posted here in case someone wants to send a PR.

# How to use the repo

So far, each challenge has its own crate. The inputs are placed in a `input.txt` in the top level directory of the crate. If you want to test my solution with your inputs, please paste the data in this text file.

I'm not sure whether it's possible to get your personal inputs via API access, but I hope to figure it out and to include that step in my solutions along the way.

A big thank you to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl) for organizing Advent of Code!
